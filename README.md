## Day 36
- Revised Federated Learning and did coding and pushed it to github
- Looking for a dataset, which could satisfy federated learning project + #sg_pytorch-robotics project
- Participated in slack
- Sending thanks and encouragemnets to #sg_pytorch-robotics mates: @Temitope Oladokun

- Participated in slack
- Sending thanks and encouragements to: @Juan Carlos Kuri Pinto @Helena Barmer @Mika @Suparna S Nair @Nancy Al Aswad @Temitope Oladokun
## Day 39
- Worked on a toy dataset with a trusted aggregator
- Trying to understand Secretive additive Sharing
## Day 40
- Read some articles on secret additive sharing
## Day 41
- Uninstalled and Installed several times pytorch,syft,raspbian from 11 am to 11 pm, to get things right for #sg_pytorch-robotics project. Million thanks to Suparna for helping me out.
## Day 42
- Day 42
- Spent more or less 10 hours in configuring, installing things on Pi (Loving Raspbian Bluster) + training RNN for #sg_pytorch-robotics project. My laptop slept at 96% :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face: I will have to go all over again )
P.S. Happy Independence Day to all Pakistanis

## Day 43
Done with the #sg_pytorch-robotics/showcase-challenge project
- After 3 failed attempts:
1. At 96% (laptop restarted)
2. At around 30 % (laptop restarted)
3. At 60 % (unstable internet)
Because of unstable internet and my laptop sudden restarting for unknown reasons.  
Learned how to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a federated way with the purpose of classifying a person's surname to its most likely language of origin.

Trained two Recurrent Neural Networks residing on two remote workers(Raspberry Pis) based on a dataset containing approximately 20.000 surnames from 18 languages of origin, and predict to which language a name belongs based on the name's spelling.

 P.S I feel like, I have mistakenly mentioned wrong day numbers on slack 60daysofudacity channel. I am sorry for that
