## Day 1
I have already completed Introducing Differential Privacy and Evaluating the privacy of a function.

Today: 
- I took the pledge. 
- I am struggling with Deep Learning with Pytorch. Tried grasping video 12 and 13 of this lesson. 
- Was confused in neural networks so took help from Andrew NG and completed the following videos from his famous Machine Learning course and gave his quiz and got 80%.
- Learned how logic operators can be represented as neural networks from Andrew NG. 

By the end of Day 1, I have my nano-degree 36% viewed. Spent 3+ hours on Day 1.

## Day 2
- Learned the basic intuition of cost function and [back propagation in neural networks](https://lnkd.in/d7vY_jx)
## Day 3
Even though Back propagation makes me wanna cry, I managed to get something out of it. Dived deeply into the derivation to find out what's really going on behind. Thanks to [this article](https://lnkd.in/dvU3iYs)

Learned that how Chain rule is a powerful tool. Back propagation is just merely a tool to calculate the derivative of error with respect to weights for gradient descent. Correspondingly, gradient descent resulting in updating weights such that it minimizes the error.

## Day 4
OMG I did it with Pytorch! <3 Lalalala. Previously, few months ago I had learnt to train neural networks using Tensorflow but I hadn't try to go in-depth then. Now when I understand much of the concepts and its maths and how pytorch has made them easier to work with, I understand the power of neural networks.

What I did today: 
- Watched an hour+ long lecture on back propagation, as suggested by udacity course mate, not to forget many other lectures, I have been trying to grasp about back propagation lately. 
https://lnkd.in/dvkJ2hm
- Revised video 12 and 13 of Lesson 2 i.e Intro to Pytorch, which were sounding alien before and got amazed how coming back to the same lecture after few days, meanwhile youtubing and googling about Back propagation, loss functions and gradient descent, strengthened my concepts and I easily learned the concepts of video 12 and 13 without pausing in between.
- Finally, attempted the following exercise.

## Day 5
- Built and trained a neural network for Fashion MNIST dataset. 
- Watched 14,15 and 16 video of Lesson Deep Learning with Pytorch.

## Day 6
I want to understand how dropout works and a coursemate suggested me [the 7th video](https://lnkd.in/dNWUCMz). but for that, first, I need to learn the first 6
I have watched first three videos and 4th is in the midst. Tried to read [this research paper](https://lnkd.in/dcWWXej) on dropout first but left it in between xD
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/4UDIX24.jpg)
## Day 7
- Did revision of half completed deep learning with pytorch.
- learned about regularization from [this source](https://lnkd.in/dt5r4BR)
## Day 8
Learned about dropout. At first it seemed to me like a funny technique, which nobody knows why works, but it does. But the "intuition" titled videos of Andrew NG always clarifies the remaining confusions, and loved the idea of drop out. How an algorithm shouldn't take any unit in layer for granted.

List of videos I watched today: 
1) [Why Regularization Reduces Overfitting (C2W1L05)](https://lnkd.in/gEepj8T)
2) [Understanding Dropout (C2W1L07)](https://lnkd.in/gbdr_RS)
3) [Dropout Regularization (C2W1L06)](https://lnkd.in/geTmeKm)
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/kAmDxv3.jpg)
## Day 9
- Watched 17 and 18 lesson of Deep Learning with PyTorch Lesson.
- Coded practically, how over fitting leads to variance.
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/YvMCgMX.png)
## Day 10
- Learned how dropout decreases variance
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/4QzpRpC.png)
- Learned the difference between training a neural network for Mnist dataset between pytorch and tensorflow from [this source](https://lnkd.in/dhXk6gz)
## Day 11
- Watched first 5 videos of [convolutional neural networks Playlist](https://lnkd.in/dmvPDf3)
and another video: [Convolutional Networks](https://lnkd.in/dxJ5fhR)

## Day 12
- Tried setting up Cuda environment in local machine by installing cuda toolkit of nvidia and download visual studio. torch.cuda.is_available() still showing False.
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/kTvMv0k.jpg)
## Day 13
- Attended today's seminar of Bobby Wagner
- Learned the types of differential privacies and their difference in between (Lesson 5 first two videos)
- Again tried to run and troubkeshoot Cuda in my local machine. Not successful so far :(
## Day 14
- Finally got my Cuda working.
- Fell in love with my GTX 960 M <3 Realized that it trains my batch of 64 images 182 times faster than my CPU :D :D :D This example can also solve confusions of my peers, who wonder what CUDA is or why they should buy CUDA supported machines or how beneficial it is to buy CUDA supportted laptops.

- Wrote my first ever kaggle kernel. This is about [Randomized response in differential Privacy](https://lnkd.in/d6-9bN7)
![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/30l7M6X.jpg)

I think the kernel is incomplete yet. I need to do de-skew the results maybe.
## Day 17
- Even though I had watched videos from 2 to 6 yesterday of local and global differential privacy lesson, I hadn't understood them fully. So today, I read people answers on slack about my confusions regarding these I posted yesterday and today on slack and practiced about the 60 70 % story in local and global differential privacy lesson.
- Updated the kaggle kernel with the (new code)[https://lnkd.in/dFisB_x]

![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/KPu0D4q.jpg)
## Day 23
- Continued on with installation of torch in pi for #sg_pytorch-robotics group project. Yesterday night I had put it on installation overnight but installation got messed up and my operating system broke and I had to reinstall it and do it all over again. I am leaving it on installation again today overnight. Hoping for the good. :( <3
## Day 24
- I was supposed to install pytorch in python 3.6 or above and I had mistakenly did in 3.5. so tadaaa again installation overnight in pi for #sg_pytorch-robotics :( 
- Revised the first four videos of lesson federated learning.
## Day 25
- Successfully Installed torch and pysft in Raspberry pi and laptop for a group project. It was a challenging task to install in raspberry pi. The installation took 24 hours to complete, ignoring the fact that another 24 hours I had wasted by installing the above packages in the wrong python version.
- Practiced a bit federated learning basic coding
- Meetup with #sg_pytorch-robotics
Sending thanks and encouragement to today's attendees: @Bhanujeet Choudhary@Elena Kutanov @Mohammad Diab @Dammy @Joyce Obi@Joyce @Marwa@erinSnPAI @Oudarjya Sen Sarma @Jess@Mateusz @qursaan @Suraiya Khan @Anju Mercian@Sourav @Ahmed MAGDY EISSA @Ayesha Manzur@Nancy Al Aswad @Droid @Laura A @susyjam @Harkirat@Vipul Aggarwal @Helena Barmer

![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/v3VuUS7.jpg)
## Day 28:
- Installed pytorch + pysyft in my another laptop + another pi (in process. Leaving it to install overnight). This time I just SSD instead of SD card with Pi and concluded that, before pi would take 12+ hours to build pytorch and with SSD it took only 3 hours. I would suggest everybody in #sg_pytorch-robotics to go for SSD instead of SD cards. I am all ready for project.

 ## Day 50
Studied about how to use rotating proxies and user agents in web scrapping (for a personal digital assistant). I need the other web scrapping practitioners in my friend list to suggest me, how do they avoid to get blocked from websites doing web scrapping?
1. Do you use free rotating IP addresses and User agents or 
2. do you use any free library which automatically handles the job of rotating IPs and user agents. 
3. do you use any paid rotating IP addresses and user agents or 
4. a paid library, which automatically handles rotating IPs and user agents.

## Day 60
Continued on with "Intro to deep learning with pytorch" course.
Last day with this scholarship challenge. I even continued this streak during my final exams of 6th semester xD. Learned a lot from the community. I didn't know until today, how truly environment affects you. Made soo many new friends. Dared to approach people like Andrew Liam Trask and Daniele Gadler personally in slack. Didn't know before, people like them are approachable. Online meetups,webinars, project and blogging competitions were fun. and the best thing is, it doesn't stop here. It revealed to me many more opportunities :D Wishing myself luck for phase 2! I look forward to join Karachi Facebook Developer Group (which is inactive these days and will become active again soon) and keep an eye on Facebook AI residency applications opening :)
