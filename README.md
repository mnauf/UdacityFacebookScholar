# Secure And Private AI Scholarship Challenge
## Day 25
- Successfully Installed torch and pysft in Raspberry pi and laptop for a group project. It was a challenging task to install in raspberry pi. The installation took 24 hours to complete, ignoring the fact that another 24 hours I had wasted by installing the above packages in the wrong python version.
- Practiced a bit federated learning basic coding
- Meetup with #sg_pytorch-robotics

## Day 26
- Watched this video about [Federated Learning: Machine Learning on Decentralized Data (Google I/O'19)](https://lnkd.in/dBmt5xi)
## Day 27
Trying to work on a little task given at the end of the video 4 of lesson federated learning where we are required to make 2 virtual workers and play with it but this error keeps popping up. Reinstalled different versions of torch and syft to make thus error go away but nothing happens.

## Day 28:
- Installed pytorch + pysyft in my another laptop + another pi (in process. Leaving it to install overnight). This time I just SSD instead of SD card with Pi and concluded that, before pi would take 12+ hours to build pytorch and with SSD it took only 3 hours. I would suggest everybody in #sg_pytorch-robotics to go for SSD instead of SD cards. I am all ready for project.
## Day 29
- Learned cloning SD card, instead of installing Everytime packages in a new SD card.
- Installed Jupyter notebook on Pi.
- Did coding on my Pi and [pushed it to GitHub](https://lnkd.in/de59Kni)
- Watched this amazing video of [How Neural networks look like in 3D](https://lnkd.in/dJy3uEy) 
## Day 30
- Practiced basic remote execution
- Played with remote tensors by sending and receiving data from two virtual workers
- Learned doing arithmetic operations on remote tensors
[Practice Code](https://github.com/mnauf/UdacityFacebookScholar/tree/master/Day30)
## Day 31

- Day 42
- Spent more or less 10 hours in configuring, installing things on Pi (Loving Raspbian Bluster) + training RNN for #sg_pytorch-robotics project. My laptop slept at 96% :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face: I will have to go all over again )
P.S. Happy Independence Day to all Pakistanis

## Day 43
Done with the #sg_pytorch-robotics/showcase-challenge project
- After 3 failed attempts:
1. At 96% (laptop restarted)
2. At around 30 % (laptop restarted)
3. At 60 % (unstable internet)
Because of unstable internet and my laptop sudden restarting for unknown reasons.  
Learned how to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a federated way with the purpose of classifying a person's surname to its most likely language of origin.

Trained two Recurrent Neural Networks residing on two remote workers(Raspberry Pis) based on a dataset containing approximately 20.000 surnames from 18 languages of origin, and predict to which language a name belongs based on the name's spelling.

 ![Books](https://imgur.com/1laZLjg.jpg)
 ## Day 49
- Learned about [ROS actions](http://www.theconstructsim.com/…/ros-cou…/ros-python-course/) and services and practically used it in simulator
- Watched [this](https://youtu.be/ZJixNvx9BAc) video about Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI | A WIRED Film.
 ## Day 50
-- Studied about how to use rotating proxies and user agents in web scrapping (for a personal digital assistant). I need the other web scrapping practitioners in my friend list to suggest me, how do they avoid to get blocked from websites doing web scrapping?
1. Do you use free rotating IP addresses and User agents or 
2. do you use any free library which automatically handles the job of rotating IPs and user agents. 
3. do you use any paid rotating IP addresses and user agents or 
4. a paid library, which automatically handles rotating IPs and user agents.
-- Learned about Unsupervised Learning from Andrew NG Machine learning course
